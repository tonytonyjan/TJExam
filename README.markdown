## For developers

### Develop Rules

*   Keep one branch per feature.
*   Don't merge to branch `master`, instead, merge to branch `dev`.

### Tips

*   Follows [XDites's Rails coding style](https://github.com/rocodev/guides) as possible as you can.
*   Write spec file before implementing anything (Just kidding, it's impossible in this project).
*   No pay, no gain.
